This project explores the relationship between study hours and exam performance using Simple Linear Regression, one of the most fundamental techniques in machine learning. By analyzing a dataset of hours studied versus marks scored, I developed a predictive model that estimates the marks a student might achieve based on the time they dedicate to studying. Although the dataset is small, it effectively demonstrates how even basic machine learning models can uncover meaningful patterns and provide valuable insights into real-world scenarios.
